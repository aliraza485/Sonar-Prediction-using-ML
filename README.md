# Sonar-Based Object Classification: Rock or Mine?
# 📌 Project Overview
This project implements a Logistic Regression model to classify objects as either rock or mine using Sonar data. The dataset consists of frequency-based sonar readings, which help distinguish between the two object types based on their unique reflection patterns.

# 🔍 Problem Statement
Detecting underwater objects is crucial for naval applications, environmental studies, and underwater exploration. This project aims to build a supervised machine learning model that can accurately classify an object based on sonar signal properties.

# 🛠️ Tech Stack
1. Python
2. Pandas, NumPy (Data Processing)
3. Scikit-Learn (Machine Learning - Logistic Regression)

# 📊 Dataset
Sonar Dataset
Features: 60 continuous values representing sonar return signals
Target: Binary classification (Rock = R, Mine = M)

# 📈 Results
The model achieved an accuracy of 76% with robust classification performance.
